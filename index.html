    <h1> Part 1: (Dividing) Integers </h1>
    <h2> 1.0: Defining Integers </h2>
    <p>
	The set of integers is $\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}.$
	</p><p>
	The set of natural numbers is $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}.$
	</p><p>
	The set of natural numbers is a subset</strong> of the set of integers. This can be represented in several ways: 
	<ul>
		<li> \(\mathbb{N}\subset\mathbb{Z}\) </li>
		<li> \(x\in\mathbb{N}\implies x\in\mathbb{Z}\) </li>
		<li> For all \(x\in\mathbb{N}\), we have \(x\in\mathbb{Z}\)
	</ul>
	We can add and multiply numbers in both \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{N}\). Note that subtraction is just adding a negative number.
	</p><p>
	Here are some properties of addition \((+)\) and multiplication \((\cdot)\) in \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{N}\):
	<ol>
		<li> $\forall x,y\in\mathbb{Z}: x+y=y+x$ (commutativity) </li>
		<li> $\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb{Z}: (x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$ (associativity) </li>
		<li> $\forall x,y,z\in\mathbb{Z}: x\cdot(y+z)=x\cdot y+x\cdot z$ (distributivity)</li>
	</ol>
	</p><p>
	<ul>
	<li> Note: the first two of the above properties extend to multiplication; we show only the additive properties for brevity.</li>
	<li>Note: again, for brevity, the three above properties are shown only in $\mathbb{Z}$, but they are true in $\mathbb{N}$ as well.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	For many sets in mathematics, we have a concept of closure. For $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$, the operations addition and multiplication are closed under their respective sets.
	</p><p>
	For an example of closure, consider addition in $\mathbb{Z}$. When two numbers in this set, say $1$ and $2$, are added, we get $3$. This is also a number in $\mathbb{Z}$, since this set is closed under the addition operation. Similarly, if you multiply or add two numbers in $\mathbb{N}$, you get another number in $\mathbb{N}$.
	</p><p>
	There are some special identity numbers (more generally, identity elements) in $\mathbb{Z}$.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>The additive identity: </strong>$\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}\text{, }\exists\text{ 0}\in\mathbb{Z}: x+0=0+x=x$ (the sum of a number and 0 is just that number).
		</li>
		<li><strong>The multiplicative identity: </strong>$\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}\text{, }\exists\text{ 1}\in\mathbb{Z}: x\cdot1=1\cdot x=x$ (the product of a number and 1 is just that number).
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p><p>
	Note that since $0\notin\mathbb{N}$, this particular set has no additive identity. The multiplicative identity of $\mathbb{N}$ is $1$.
	</p><p>
	We will begin to omit the dot symbol ($\cdot$) when performing multiplication. We will instead use the convention that $ab$ means $a$ and $b$ are being multiplied.
	</p><p>
	We now establish the meaning of the unary absolute value operator: if $x\in\mathbb{Z}$, we define the absolute value of $x$ as 
	$$|x| =
	 \begin{cases}
	 x & \text{ if }x>0\\
	 -x & \text{ if }x\leq 0
	 \end{cases}$$
With this definition, $|3|=3$ and $|-2|=2$, as we would expect.
	</p><p>
	Recall that the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is closed under multiplication. This implies that the product of two positive numbers is positive.
	<ul><li>We can further this inference: for integers $a,b$, we have $|ab|\geq\max(\{a,b\})$. The absolute value of the product of two integers is usually greater than the individual value of either of those two integers.</li></ul>
	</p><p>
	With these tools, we can move on to divisibility.</p>
   <h2> 1.1: Divisibility of Integers </h2>
   <p> We begin with the definition of divisibility.</p>
	</p><p>
	<strong>Definition of divisibility: </strong> Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$. We say $a$ divides $b$ if there exists an integer $c$ such that $ac=b$.</p>
	<ul>
		<li> In other words, if $a$ divides $b$, then we can multiply $a$ by something to get $b$.</li>
		<li> If $a$ divides $b$, we write $a|b$.</li>
	</ul>
	</p><p>
		As an example of divisibility, consider integers $5$ and $10$. We say $5$ divides $10$, or $5|10$, since $5\cdot 2=10$.
	</p><p>
		We can now prove some statements about divsibility:
	<ol>
	<li> If $ab=1$, then $a=b=1$ or $a=b=-1$. </li>
	<li> If $a|b$ and $b|a$, then $a=b$ or $a=-b$. </li>
	<li> If $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a|c$.</li>
	<li> If $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a$ divides all numbers of the form $bm + cn$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers.
	</ol>
	<ul><li>Note: the third statement describes the transitivity of divisibility. The fourth statement describes the ability of $a$ to divide all linear combinations of $b$ and $c$.</li></ul>
	<strong>Proofs:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> 
		Since $ab=1$, we trivially have $|ab|=1$ as well. 
		<br>Recall that $|ab|=1\leq\max(\{a,b\})$.
		<br>Without loss of generality, assume $\max(\{a,b\})=a$. Then $a=1$ and therefore $b=1$ as well.
	</li>
	<li>
		From the assumptions, we have $a=bc$ and $b=ak$ for some integers $c,k$.<br>
		Combine the above two equations. We get $a=bc=(ak)c$, so $a=a(kc)$. This implies that $kc=1$.<br>
		$kc=1$ implies $k=c=1$ or $k=c=-1$. <br>If the former is true, $a=b$. If the latter is true, $a=-b$.
	</li>	
	<li>From the assumptions, we have $a=bm$ and $b=cn$ for some integers $m$ and $n$.<br>
		Combine the above two equations. $a=bm=(cn)m$, so $a=c(nm)$. <br>
		The last equation implies $a$ divides $c$.
	</li>
	<li> From the assumptions, we have $a=bm$ and $a=cn$ for some integers $m$ and $n$.<br>
	$a$ can divide itself. $a|a$.<br>
	$a$ can divide itself again. $a|2a$.<br>
	From the first line of this proof, $a=bm=cn$, so $a+a=bm+cn=2a.$<br>
	Since $a$ can divide $2a$, we also have $a$ can divide $bm+cn$.
	</p>
	</ol>
	<p>
	We now move to prime numbers.
	</p>	
	<h2> 1.2: Prime Numbers </h2>
	<p> <Strong> Definition of prime number:</strong> a natural number $p$ is prime if it can be divided only by itself and 1.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The set of prime numbers is a subset of the natural numbers.</li>
		<li>The only even prime number is 2. All other even numbers are divisible by 2 and are hence not prime.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	There is an important characteristic of natural numbers: every natural number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers.
	<ul><li>This prime factorization is unique (independently of the order it presents the prime numbers in).</li>
	<li>This means we can write, for all natural numbers $n$, $$n=p_{0}\cdot\cdot\cdot p_{k},$$ where each $p_{i}$ is a prime number.</li>
	<li><strong>Proof (without uniqueness)</strong>: We do this proof by <a href="./Appendix.html">mathematical induction</a>. <br>The <u>base case</u> is done with the smallest prime number, $n=2$. Since $n=2$ is prime, we have trivially found a prime factorization for $2$ and proven the base case. 
	<br>For the <u>induction step</u>, consider a natural number $m$. Assume that all natural numbers $n< m$ have a prime factorization (we are generalizing the base case).
	<br>Given this assumption, we now prove that $m$ has a prime factorization. 
	<br> We consider two cases: if $m$ is prime and if $m$ is not prime.
	<br> If the former is true, then we have proven the statement trivially.
	<br> If the latter is true, then $m$ can be written as $m=ab$ for $a,b$ natural numbers nonprime. 
	<br> Both $a$ and $b$ must be less than $m$. Since we assumed all natural numbers less than $m$ have a prime factorization, $a$ and $b$ have respective prime factorizations:
	$$a=a_{0}\cdot\cdot\cdot a_{k}\text{ and } b=b_{0}\cdot\cdot\cdot b_{j},$$
	where all $a_{i}$ and $b_{j}$ are prime numbers. Now we can write
	$$ m = ab = (a_{0}\cdot\cdot\cdot a_{k})(b=b_{0}\cdot\cdot\cdot b_{j}),$$
	which is a prime factorization for $m$.
</ul>
